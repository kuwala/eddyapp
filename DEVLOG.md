# Dev log for eddyapp 1

Installing and configuring the web dev tools.

Installed CSS 

Adding css via npm and importing it into the project. After a bit of research I have landed on a process of importing the css via rollup js. Svelte uses rollup and this will continue in the same direction. The css will now be added to the project. 

First I am going to test it to see if it is really not working. 

After adding some example code. It actually works well. I can hold on on installing rollup.

Once I do need it I have found this link and it seems that the community agrrees on this method. (Rollup css for a svelte project)[https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-import-css-files-to-svelte]

(npm link)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-css-only]

Rollup is a module bundler for javascript. (more info here)[https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/]
